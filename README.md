# UltraSockets
Quasi-Application layer protocol to provide secure, fast, and light communication between devices on (W)LAN. It's built to facilitate "casual" data transfer between devices such as laptops and microcontrollers. It is easier and faster to develop compared to TCP, while not having as high of an overhead and baggage as HTTP. 

## Features:

####   1. Full-duplex communication with fully-automated threading to enable it

####   2. Supports efficient multiple client-client communication

####   3. Adds Asynchronous Transmission to preserve data integrity

####   4. Has a user-friendly handshake layer which can be modified to provide encryption and compression
