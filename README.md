# UltraSockets
Quasi-Application layer protocol to provide fast and light communication between devices on (W)LAN. It's built to facilitate "casual" data transfer between devices such as laptops and microcontrollers. It is easier and faster to develop compared to TCP, while not having as high of an overhead and baggage as HTTP.

## Features:

####   1. Full-duplex communication with fully-automated threading to enable it

####   2. Supports efficient multiple client-client communication

####   3. Has a user-friendly handshake layer which can be modified to provide encryption and compression

## Installation

This project is compatible with all versions of Python 3. 

Run this to install the package: 
```bash
pip install ultra-sockets
```
